# Risk Assessment

## Risk Assessment Approach
Risks identified during the penetration testing assessment were evaluated based on two primary factors:
- **Impact**: The potential damage to the organization if the vulnerability were exploited
- **Likelihood**: The probability of the vulnerability being exploited given existing controls

Each risk was assigned a qualitative rating of Low, Medium, or High.

## Identified Risks Summary

| Vulnerability            | Impact | Likelihood | Overall Risk |
|--------------------------|--------|------------|--------------|
| SQL Injection            | High   | Medium     | High         |
| Cross-Site Scripting     | Medium | Medium     | Medium       |

## Risk Analysis Details

### SQL Injection
- **Impact**: High  
  Unauthorized access to backend databases could lead to exposure or modification of sensitive data.
- **Likelihood**: Medium  
  The vulnerability is present in a publicly accessible endpoint, but exploitation requires specific input.
- **Overall Risk**: High  

### Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
- **Impact**: Medium  
  Successful exploitation could result in session hijacking or unauthorized actions on behalf of users.
- **Likelihood**: Medium  
  User input is reflected in application responses without sufficient encoding.
- **Overall Risk**: Medium  

## Business Impact
If left unaddressed, these vulnerabilities could negatively affect:
- Customer trust
- Data confidentiality
- Application availability
- Regulatory and compliance posture

## Conclusion
High-risk vulnerabilities should be prioritized for immediate remediation, followed by medium-risk findings as part of ongoing security improvement efforts.
